*¬π=the **fallback scheme** is defined on the first page of the [LNURL specifications](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc#fallback-scheme). It allows to embed an bech32-encoded LNURL string into a normal Web-URL so that for example a LNURL QR code can be opened on every smartphone as a fallback with a normal web browser (if a specialised wallet app is not installed yet). Every LNURL supporting wallet should be able to parse such Web-URLs for bech32-encoded LNURL strings - it easy to implement and just requires a handfull of additional lines of code.*
